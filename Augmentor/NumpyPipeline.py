"""
The Pipeline module is the user facing API for the Augmentor package. It
contains the :class:`~Augmentor.Pipeline.Pipeline` class which is used to
create pipeline objects, which can be used to build an augmentation pipeline
by adding operations to the pipeline object.

For a good overview of how to use Augmentor, along with code samples and
example images, can be seen in the :ref:`mainfeatures` section.
